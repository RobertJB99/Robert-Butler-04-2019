 <h3>Communication</h3>
 
 <p>Hello (client name or to whom it may concern),
  <br>  My name is Robert Butler an employee at MidWestern Interactive. I am currently working on an "about us" part of your web page and I would like to request a few things so I can spruce it up. If you would send me a few paragraphs summarizing the history of the company, what your company does, and a little about yourself. Also If you could send me a few photos maby of yourself, your employees, and some old photos along with some new photos of your business would be very helpful. Thank you and let me know if you would like me to add anything else to the page.

<br>Sincerely,
<br>  Robert Butler</p>
  
 <h3> Code Test</h3>
  <p>I tried to replicate everything to the best of my ability. The only thing I could not figure out was getting the cards footers to line up withought destroying the look of the page.</p>
